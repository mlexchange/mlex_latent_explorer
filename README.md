# MLExchange Latent Space Explorer 

An app to visulize latent vectors in 2D or 3D. It supports PCA and UMAP for dimension reduction.
 
To run this demo:
- install Docker.
- clone and run the MLExchange [Compute API](https://github.com/mlexchange/mlex_computing_api) and [Content Registry](https://github.com/mlexchange/mlex_content_registry) in their corresponding folders.
- clone the [PCA](https://github.com/runboj/mlex_dimension_reduction_pca) and [UMAP](https://github.com/runboj/mlex_dimension_reduction_umap) repo.
    - Register these two models in Content Registry using the json file in the description folder
    - Run these two models in Docker
- clone this repo and then run `docker-compose up` in the main folder.  
- Go to `http://0.0.0.0:8070/` in a brower.

## Developer Setup
If you are developing this library, there are a few things to note.

1. Install development dependencies:

```
pip install .
pip install ".[dev]"
```

2. Install pre-commit
This step will setup the pre-commit package. After this, commits will get run against flake8, black, isort.

```
pre-commit install
```

3. (Optional) If you want to check what pre-commit would do before commiting, you can run:

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

4. To run test cases:

```
python -m pytest
```
