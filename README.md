# MLExchange Latent Space Explorer

An application for visualizing latent vectors in **2D or 3D** using **PCA** and **UMAP** for dimensionality reduction.

## Running as a Standalone Application (Using Docker)

The **Prefect server, Tiled server, the application, and the Prefect worker job** all run within a **single Docker container**. This eliminates the need to start the servers separately.

However, the **Prefect worker** must be run separately on your local machine (refer to step 5). 

## Steps to Run the Application

### 1 Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mlexchange/mlex_latent_explorer.git
cd mlex_latent_explorer
```

### 2 Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file using `.env.example` as a reference:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Then **update the** `.env` file with the correct values.

**Important Note:** Due to the current tiled configuration, ensure that the `WRITE_DIR` is a subdirectory of the `READ_DIR` if the same tiled server is used for both reading data and writing results.

#### MLFlow Configuration in .env

When setting `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` in the `.env` file:

- If you run the [MLFlow server](https://github.com/xiaoyachong/mlex_mlflow) locally, you can set it to:
  ```
  MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="http://mlflow-server:5000"
  ```
  This works because the MLFlow server also runs in the `mle_net` Docker network.

- If you run MLFlow server on vaughan and use SSH port forwarding:
  ```
  ssh -S forward -L 5000:localhost:5000 <your-username>@vaughan.als.lbl.gov
  ```
  Then you can set it to:
  ```
  MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="http://host.docker.internal:5000"
  ```

### 3 Build and Start the Application

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

* `-d` â†’ Runs the containers in the background (detached mode).

### 4 Verify Running Containers

```sh
docker ps
```

### 5 Start a Prefect Worker

Open another terminal and start a Prefect worker. Refer to [mlex_prefect_worker](https://github.com/mlexchange/mlex_prefect_worker) for detailed instructions on setting up and running the worker.


### 6 Access the Application

Once the container is running, open your browser and visit:
* **Dash app:** http://localhost:8070/

### 7 Stopping the Application

To stop and remove the running containers, use:

```sh
docker compose down
```

This will **shut down all services** but **retain data** if volumes are used.

## Model Description

For dimension reduction:
- [PCA](https://github.com/mlexchange/mlex_dimension_reduction_pca)

- [UMAP](https://github.com/mlexchange/mlex_dimension_reduction_umap)

For clustering:
- [KMeans, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN](https://github.com/mlexchange/mlex_clustering)

## Developer Setup
If you are developing this library, there are a few things to note.

1. Install development dependencies:

```
pip install .
pip install ".[dev]"
```

2. Install pre-commit
This step will setup the pre-commit package. After this, commits will get run against flake8, black, isort.

```
pre-commit install
```

3. (Optional) If you want to check what pre-commit would do before commiting, you can run:

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

4. To run test cases:

```
python -m pytest
```
